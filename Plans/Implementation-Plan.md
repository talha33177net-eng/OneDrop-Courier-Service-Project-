# Implementation plan and progress tracker

The one place to see where we are and what comes next for **OneDrop Courier**, the traditional courier system
(pickup, hubs, delivery, cash on delivery, next-day payouts). The grouped-delivery plan it replaces (2026-09-27 to
2026-10-04) is in git history up to commit `3b48bc9`.

**Start of every session:** read [Today](#today), then take the first unchecked task.
**End of every task:** run the [test routine](#test-routine-after-every-task), tick the box, add a line to the
[daily log](#daily-log).

## Today

| | |
|---|---|
| Current phase | **Phase 4** — the admin panel and payouts the courier can steer |
| Next task | 4.10 recipients pay COD online, if the owner says go (recommended); otherwise 4.3 Courier settings. Still waiting on the owner: 2.1 review and commit of everything since `ce576c1` (all uncommitted on `main`); 2.6 and 2.7 wait on accounts and a decision |
| Last session | 2026-10-08 — 4.9: merchants pay what they owe online through SSLCommerz, proved on the owner's sandbox store |
| Blockers | None |

## Test routine (after every task)

A task is **not done** until all of these pass. Record the result in the daily log.

1. **Build:** `dotnet build Courier.sln` shows 0 errors and no warnings.
2. **New tests:** every new rule gets a unit test in `tests/Domain.Tests`. Anything touching the database, the
   API, a page or tenancy gets an integration test in `tests/Integration.Tests` (and its line in the isolation sweep
   for a new route).
3. **Schema changed?** `./tools/db/publish.ps1` (dev) **and** `./tools/db/publish.ps1 -Database OneDrop-Test`.
4. **All suites green:**
   ```powershell
   dotnet test --project tests/Domain.Tests
   dotnet test --project tests/Architecture.Tests
   dotnet test --project tests/Integration.Tests     # must say succeeded, not skipped
   ```
5. **Live check:** `dotnet run --project src/Web`, then use the feature on http://onedrop.localhost:5080 at desktop and
   phone width. Check another merchant, rider or courier cannot see it.
6. **Update this file:** tick the task, note anything deferred, update [Today](#today).

## Phase 1 — The rebuild as a traditional courier ✅ (2026-10-04)

The owner's request: "Forget the group delivery system … make this project just like the traditional delivery
systems of Bangladesh like Steadfast … make the UI normal, minimal and good looking … make every user panel and the
admin panel better." Owner's answers: start from the last commit (stash the uncommitted work), keep the multi-tenant
base with one courier seeded, reset both databases, recipients track publicly with no accounts.

- [x] **1.1 Domain.** Grouping, customers, orders, trips, shelves, door payments, settlements, trust and drop-off rules
      removed. New: `Parcel` (state machine, location fields, charges snapshot, events), `ServiceArea` and
      `DeliveryRate`, `Merchant` (status, payout account), `PickupPoint`, `Rider`, `DeliveryRun`, `DeliveryAttempt`,
      `PickupRequest`, `LedgerEntry`, `Payout`; `PhoneNumber` moved to `Domain.Common`; `Tenant` keeps only name, slug,
      time zone, currency, SMS sender, hotline and maximum attempts.
- [x] **1.2 Schema and seed.** SQL project rewritten (schemas `Parcels`, `Pricing`; `Delivery`, `Payments`, `Network`,
      `Merchants` reshaped), sequences `TrackingNumber` and `PayoutNumber`, the security policy on all 17 tenant tables.
      DbUp history replaced by `001_SeedCourier.sql` (16 hubs, 21 zones, 87 areas, the rate card). Both databases
      dropped and deployed from nothing.
- [x] **1.3 Application.** Booking (API, form, CSV), browse and details, actions (edit, cancel, return), labels,
      tracking, quote, fraud check; hub scan, board, assign, runs; pickups; rider day; riders; merchant onboarding,
      admin, account; payouts job, merchant payments, admin payouts; rates; coverage; dashboards; outbox contracts,
      recipient texts, webhooks, failed messages.
- [x] **1.4 Infrastructure.** Mappings, `AppDbContext`, Identity without customers, tracking links, user accounts, fake
      payout gateway, the demo seeder (logins, merchants, riders, keys) and `DemoActivity` (sample parcels in every
      stage in Development), Hangfire job `merchant-payouts`.
- [x] **1.5 UI.** A new design system (`site.css`: tokens, dark sidebar shell, cards, stats, badges, tables, tabs,
      timeline, charts, public site, rider mobile, print labels) with inline SVG icons; public site, sign-in and
      sign-up; merchant, hub, rider, admin, platform and Dev panels rebuilt.
- [x] **1.6 API.** `POST/GET /api/v1/parcels`, `POST /api/v1/parcels/{code}/cancel`, `GET /api/v1/charge`,
      `GET /api/v1/areas`.
- [x] **1.7 Tests.** Domain tests rewritten (parcels, pricing, money, delivery, merchants, webhooks, outbox); integration
      tests rewritten (parcel API, merchant panel, delivery flows, payouts, webhooks, texts, failed messages, portal
      pages, simulator, isolation sweep over every route, wrong-host sweep, Row-Level Security, save interceptor).
- [x] **1.8 Simulator, docs.** Simulator books parcels; README, Project-Context, Architecture, Demo, Conventions,
      Database rewritten for the courier.

---

## Phase 2 — After the rebuild

- [ ] **2.1 Owner's review and commit** on `traditional-courier`; merge into `main` when approved.
- [x] **2.2 Coverage admin** (2026-10-06). `/Admin/Coverage` keeps the map it always showed and gains three tabs:
      hubs, zones (code, name, city, suburb, hub) and areas (name, zone, filtered by zone). The seed still lays the
      map out; a part of it that leaves is archived, never deleted, and refuses to move while work rests on it.
- [x] **2.3 Run sheet** (2026-10-06). `/Hub/RunSheet/{run}`: the parcels still to hand over with the door, the phone,
      the cash and a line to sign; offered when parcels are assigned and from the closing page. Printed from the page.
- [x] **2.4 Merchant notifications** (2026-10-06). The merchant is emailed when its payout has left: what was
      collected, the charges, what was sent, to which account, and a link to the invoice. Through the outbox.
- [x] **2.5 Reports** (2026-10-06). `/Admin/Reports` over a chosen period: day by day (delivered, returned, cash,
      charges, earned, owed), by rider (stops, deliveries, cash collected against handed in, short) and returns by
      merchant. Each table downloads as CSV.
- [~] **2.6 Real gateways.** **Email is real** (SMTP, Gmail today; `Email:*` in `appsettings.Local.json`) and sends
      the merchant notifications. **SMS and the bKash / Nagad / bank payout adapters stay fakes**: the owner has no
      accounts with those providers yet (2026-10-06), so recipients' texts are still listed at `/Dev/Sms`.
- [ ] **2.7 The app's own SQL login** without `ALTER ANY SECURITY POLICY` (shown to the owner before it is created).
      Left alone for now by the owner's choice (2026-10-06): the app still signs in as `sa`.

---

## Phase 3 — The gaps found in Steadfast's merchant panel (owner, 2026-10-06)

The owner walked through Steadfast's panel again and asked for the features we do not have. One task at a time, each
with the full test routine. Moderators first, by the owner's choice.

- [x] **3.1 Moderators** (2026-10-06). People who work inside a merchant account with their own sign-in and their own permissions
      (dashboard, parcels, payments, support, settings), invited by email with a code; the account owner chooses what
      each may see and do, and can stop them. New table, invitation flow, a permission check on every merchant page.
- [x] **3.2 More parcel tabs** (2026-10-07). Partly delivered is a tab of its own; hub staff and admins flag a parcel
      **in review** or **exceptional** with what is wrong (`Parcel.Issue`), clear it with what was done, and the
      flagged parcel stays off riders' runs meanwhile. The merchant sees the flag tabs while they hold a parcel, the
      flag on the parcel and on its dashboard, and in the API.
- [x] **3.3 Stats page** (2026-10-07). `/Merchant/Stats`: the parcels booked in the last 7 or 30 days, this month,
      last month or the merchant's own days (`Domain.Common.Period`, at most a year): booked with their cash, the
      delivery, return and cancel rates, cash collected, where they are now as one bar, and count, cash and share per
      status with a link to each status's parcels for those days.
- [x] **3.4 Returns the merchant signs for** (2026-10-07). `/Hub/Returns` sends a pickup point's returning parcels
      back with a rider on a return list (`RL-100001`); the rider records the hand-over (each parcel returned and
      charged) or why not on `/Rider/Return/{number}`; the merchant follows `/Merchant/Returns` and confirms a list on
      `/Merchant/Return/{number}`, with a note when something is missing.
- [x] **3.5 Cancellation and amount-change requests** (2026-10-07). From a parcel on its way the merchant asks to
      cancel it or change its cash (`Parcels.ParcelRequest`); admins approve (the parcel changes at once) or refuse
      with a reason on `/Admin/Requests`; the merchant sees answers on the parcel and `/Merchant/Requests`. Replaces
      the merchant's direct "Ask for it back".
- [x] **3.6 Payment request and several payout accounts** (2026-10-07). Several saved accounts
      (`Merchants.MerchantPayoutAccount`), one in use; "Get paid now" on Payments pays every unpaid line at once,
      today's too; the balance splits into ready, today and still to collect.
- [x] **3.7 Notifications in the panel** (2026-10-07). A bell in the merchant's top bar with the last week's
      deliveries, holds, refusals, returns, flags, return lists, answered requests and payouts; worked out, not stored.
- [x] **3.8 Small things from the same panel** (2026-10-07). `/Merchant/Export` (full CSV, up to 10,000),
      `/Merchant/ByDate`, the merchant ID with a copy button (account menu, Settings, admin search), and empty lists
      that offer their next action.

Not taken from Steadfast: a prepaid wallet ("Add fund", "Check balance"), a different money model from our COD ledger
that needs a real gateway (2.6); Pick-n-Drop and "My incoming", which are another service line; and the Bangla
switch, which the owner parked on 2026-10-06.

---

## Phase 4 — The admin panel and payouts the courier can steer (owner, 2026-10-07)

The owner asked whether merchant payouts work (they do: every payout equals its lines, no line paid twice) and what
the admin panel is missing, then "Lets fix these". Payouts come first, because the admin's bell needs a stuck payout
to say why it is stuck.

- [x] **4.1 Payouts the admin can steer** (2026-10-07). A failed transfer keeps why, how often and when it was tried, and the admin
      sends it again or cancels it (its lines are freed for a new payout to the account as it is now). Hold or pay one
      merchant. Merchants who owe the courier listed apart, and an adjustment line (the merchant paid us, or a credit
      or charge with a reason) to settle them. A short "how payouts work" box, and when the hourly run last ran and runs
      next.
- [x] **4.2 A bell for the admin** (2026-10-07). Sign-ups waiting, requests to answer, flagged parcels, failed messages, stuck
      payouts, riders short of cash, notes on return lists, merchants owed money with no payout account.
- [ ] **4.3 Courier settings.** Name, hotline, SMS sender, delivery attempts and businesses per account, today only in
      the database.
- [ ] **4.4 Staff accounts.** Add, edit and stop hub staff and admin logins.
- [ ] **4.5 The whole merchant for the admin.** Its businesses, moderators, payout accounts, balance and payouts,
      requests and return rate.
- [ ] **4.6 Stuck parcels.** Parcels that have not moved for too many days at a hub, between hubs or on hold; the days
      are the courier's setting.
- [ ] **4.7 A page per rider.** Runs, deliveries, and cash handed in against cash collected.
- [ ] **4.8 A pass over every admin page** at desktop and phone width, fixing what is broken.
- [x] **4.9 Merchants pay what they owe online, through SSLCommerz** (2026-10-08, owner's sandbox store). "Pay ৳X
      online" on Payments when the charges come to more than the cash; the gateway is asked before anything is
      credited, one credit per payment, a check job for payers who never came back, risky payments held for the
      admin. A test gateway (`/Dev/Pay`) in Development without a store. Proved on the owner's real sandbox store:
      a bKash payment credited, a "success with risk" Nagad payment held and then credited by the admin.
- [ ] **4.10 Recipients pay their COD online** (recommended next, waiting for the owner's go-ahead). A "Pay now" on
      the tracking page; the rider collects ৳0; refunds through SSLCommerz when a paid parcel is refused or comes back.

Kept as it is, by decision: payouts do not wait for a rider's cash. The merchant is paid what the door collected and
a short rider is the courier's matter with its rider; 4.2 and 4.7 make the shortfall impossible to miss.

## Background jobs

| When | Job |
|---|---|
| Every 5 seconds (`Jobs:OutboxInterval`) | Outbox senders in process, each in a loop of its own: recipient texts, merchants' webhooks, and merchants' emails |
| Every hour (`Jobs:Payouts`) | `merchant-payouts`: every merchant's ledger lines up to yesterday (courier's day) |
| Every 10 minutes (`Jobs:OnlinePayments`) | `online-payments`: asks the gateway about online payments still waiting or failed in the last day; credits what it confirms, closes what was never finished after a day |

## Must-pass tests

| Test | Where |
|---|---|
| Charges follow the rate card per service area and weight; COD charge rounded | `PricingTests`, `ParcelApiTests` |
| A parcel moves only along its state machine; at most one location | `ParcelTests` |
| The last failed attempt returns the parcel | `ParcelTests`, `DeliveryFlowTests` |
| A merchant sees only its own parcels; a rider only theirs; another courier nothing | `IsolationTests` (every route), `ParcelApiTests`, `RowLevelSecurityTests` |
| A payout pays each line once and carries charges larger than the cash | `PayoutTests`, `MoneyTests` |
| Every entity (except Platform) has a TenantId | `TenantOwnershipTests` |

## Decisions log

The decisions and their reasons are in [Project-Context.md §4](../Documentation/Project-Context.md#4-decisions-and-the-reasons-for-them).
New ones are added there and dated here.

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-10-04 | Pivot to a traditional courier; start from `3b48bc9`, stash the uncommitted Week 5 rewrite; keep multi-tenancy with one courier; reset both databases; public tracking only (owner) |
| 2026-10-04 | SQL Server reached at `10.50.0.1,1433` over the VPN instead of `ras-x2` (owner) |
| 2026-10-06 | SQL Server reached as `ras-x2,1433` again (owner) |
| 2026-10-06 | The coverage map stays seeded but the admin adds, edits and takes off hubs, zones and areas; what comes off is archived, never deleted, and a part of the map with work on it refuses to move (owner) |
| 2026-10-06 | The features missing against Steadfast's merchant panel become Phase 3, in the owner's order, moderators first; no prepaid wallet, no Pick-n-Drop, no Bangla switch (owner) |
| 2026-10-06 | A moderator is a merchant login plus a permission row on the account's main profile; merchant pages are default-deny against a page-to-permission list; the first password is handed over by the owner because there is no email sender |
| 2026-10-06 | Email replaces SMS as the real channel, for merchants only: a real SMTP sender (Gmail app password in `appsettings.Local.json`) carries the payout notification; recipients keep the fake SMS until there is a gateway (owner) |
| 2026-10-06 | The bKash / Nagad / bank payout gateways and the app's own SQL login are left as they are until the owner has the accounts and makes the call (owner) |
| 2026-10-07 | Problems a hub flags (in review, exceptional) are a flag beside the parcel's status, not new statuses; a flagged parcel is not handed to a rider; only a parcel the courier has can be flagged |
| 2026-10-07 | Returns go back on a return list a rider carries; the hand-over returns and charges each parcel, the merchant's confirmation is a signature, not a gate |
| 2026-10-07 | After pickup a merchant's cancel or cash change is a request the admins answer; this replaces the merchant's direct "Ask for it back" |
| 2026-10-07 | Several payout accounts per merchant account, the one in use copied onto the main profile; "Get paid now" pays every unpaid line at once with the run's own rules, no limit on how often |
| 2026-10-07 | The bell is worked out from existing rows when a page is drawn; "seen" is a cookie per login. The merchant ID is shown (owner's request) as the one exception to "never show a raw id" |
| 2026-10-07 | Phase 4: payouts the admin can steer (refused transfers with their reason, send again, cancel; hold one account; adjustments), then the admin's bell, settings, staff, merchant, stuck parcels, rider pages and a pass over every page (owner). Payouts keep not waiting for a rider's cash |
| 2026-10-08 | SSLCommerz (owner's sandbox) takes money in, first for merchants paying what they owe: an adjustment credit, believed only when the gateway confirms it to our server, once. Not a payout gateway (it cannot send money out) and no prepaid wallet (the payout run would pay a top-up straight back). Recipients paying COD online is the recommended next step |

---

## Daily log

Newest first.

### 2026-10-08 (later: tabs that do not reload the page, and work marks in the menu)
- **Owner's requests:** "In payout box when i click any one these [All, Paid, Processing, Cancelled] the whole page
  loads", then "In side menu add a red ! circle for tabs … where there is work to do … for admin, marchent, rider panel".
- **Tabs in place.** `site.js` gained a shared behaviour: a part marked `data-swap="name"` whose link points to the same
  page with another query fetches the page and swaps only that part, and pushes the address, so back, reload and a
  shared link still work; anything unexpected (an error, a redirect to sign-in) falls back to following the link. The
  part fades only when the answer is slow. Used by the payouts card on `/Admin/Payouts`; other filters can opt in.
- **Work marks.** `MenuWorkHandler` answers, with a few `EXISTS` reads per page, where open work waits: for the admin
  sign-ups, requests, flagged parcels (Parcels), work at the hubs, failed messages and stuck payouts (refused, held
  online payments, owed with no payout account); for the merchant parcels booked with no pickup asked for, return
  lists to confirm, and no payout account (Settings); for the rider deliveries or return lists to hand over, and
  pickups to collect. The layout puts a red "!" on those menu items and favourites, and on the phone's menu button.
  What merely happened stays in the bell.
- **Tested:** build 0 warnings; architecture 6; `BellTests` 3 of 3 on `OneDrop-Test` (new: the merchant's pickups
  marked once it books and cleared once the parcel is at the hub, another merchant unmarked, the rider's deliveries
  marked once assigned, the admin's merchants marked for a sign-up). Live on dev: the payouts page carries the swap
  part and the served script has it. **Not done:** a click-through in a browser (the DevTools browser was in use), so
  the swap itself has not been seen working; the hub staff's own menu has no marks yet.

### 2026-10-08 (SSLCommerz: merchants pay what they owe online)
- **Owner's request:** "i opend a ssl for the demo mode" (an SSLCommerz sandbox store). Asked what it should be for, the
  owner picked every option and said: "i dont know. Im confused about this. im doing this project just to show in py
  portfolio. But i want the logic to be perfect." Recommended and built: merchants pay what they owe (4.9); recipients
  paying COD online (4.10) next, with refunds; no prepaid wallet (the hourly payout run would pay a top-up straight
  back); SSLCommerz cannot be the payout gateway (it only takes money in).
- **4.9 done.** `Domain/Payments/OnlinePayment.cs` (started, paid, failed, held for review, refunded; `Confirm` credits
  an `Adjustment` line once, even after a failure; risky or another amount is held; `MethodName` reads "BKASH-BKash"
  as "bKash"). `IPaymentGateway` with `SslcommerzGateway` (session API, validation API, transaction query),
  `FakePaymentGateway` and `/Dev/Pay` (Development without a store), `NoPaymentGateway` elsewhere.
  `OnlinePaymentsHandler` (start from the server's own balance; return, notice and the `online-payments` job all ask
  the gateway first; the admin credits or records a refund) and `PaymentReturnController` (`/pay/{transaction}/…`,
  `/pay/notice`, open to anyone, nothing posted believed). Pages: "Pay ৳X online" and a return banner on
  `/Merchant/Payments`, "Paid online" on statements, held payments and the latest on `/Admin/Payouts`, a line in the
  admin's bell. Table `Payments.OnlinePayment`, sequence `Payments.OnlinePaymentNumber`, in the security policy; both
  databases published. The store id and password are in the git-ignored `src/Web/appsettings.Local.json`.
- **Tested:** build 0 warnings; domain **200** (13 new), architecture 6; integration: the full suite **94 of 94, none
  skipped** (three new `OnlinePaymentsTests`: credited once, a forged return credits nothing, the check job credits a
  payer who never came back and closes an unfinished one, risky held and credited by the admin, cancelled credits
  nothing, another courier reaches none of it; sweep lines for `/Dev/Pay` and both `/pay` routes). After the last
  changes (sorting, admin layout, method names, and the tests forced onto the test gateway because the real store
  is now in `appsettings.Local.json`) `OnlinePaymentsTests` again: **3 of 3**.
- **Live:** on `OneDrop-Test` with the test gateway, then with the owner's **real SSLCommerz sandbox**: Chattogram
  Crafts charged ৳150, paid by bKash on SSLCommerz's page, credited (the gateway said ৳146.25 reaches the courier after
  its fee); charged ৳120, paid by Nagad with "Success with risk", held, shown to the admin with the gateway's reason
  ("Not Safe"), credited. Merchant page at 1440 px and 390 px, no sideways scroll.
- **What the live check caught, fixed:** the gateway's raw label ("BKASH-BKash") on statements, the pay dialog in the
  warning colour, and the admin's refund box running off the table.
- **Then (owner):** "dont show this page at localhost:5080. i want it to start with http://onedrop.localhost:5080/".
  The bare domain now sends visitors to the courier named by `Tenancy:HomeCourier` (`onedrop`; the list of couriers
  shows only when none is set); platform admins still sign in at `localhost:5080/Account/Login` and land on the list.
  The launch profile opens `http://onedrop.localhost:5080/`. New `PortalPagesTests` case; the class passed 12 of 12.
- **Worth knowing:** SSLCommerz's merchant panel is `sandbox-gw.sslcommerz.com` but its API is still
  `sandbox.sslcommerz.com`. Its notice cannot reach localhost, which is why the check job exists. The owner asked
  (again) never to run the full integration suite after a change, and to keep it in the background when it is needed.

### 2026-10-07 (later: Phase 4 begins, payouts and the admin's bell)
- **Owner's request:** after "do merchant payouts work?" and a list of what the admin panel lacks, "Lets fix these". Became Phase 4.
- **4.1 done.** `Payout` keeps `FailedAttempts`, `LastError`, `LastTriedOn`, `AdjustmentsTotal` and can be `Cancelled` (its lines freed); `LedgerEntry` kind `Adjustment` with a `Note` and no parcel; `Merchant.PayoutHold` per account. `PayoutsJob.SendAgainAsync`, `CancelAsync`, `PayNowAsync` returning whether the money left; `IJobSchedule` reads Hangfire for the last and next run. `/Admin/Payouts`: how payouts work, the run's times (and a warning when late), refused transfers with send again, owed and owing lists (first 15, with totals). `/Admin/Payout/{n}`: send again, cancel. `/Admin/Merchant/{id}`: hold, release, pay now, adjustments. `/Dev/Payouts` can make the fake refuse an account. Both databases published.
- **4.2 done.** `AdminBellHandler`: sign-ups, requests, flags, failed messages, refused payouts, owed with no account, short riders and return list notes of the week; drawn in the layout for admins.
- **Tested:** build 0 warnings; domain **187** (five new), architecture 6, integration **91 of 91, none skipped** (four new: refused and sent again, cancelled and paid to a corrected account, held and adjusted, the admin's bell). Live on `OneDrop-Test` (port 5090) at desktop and 390 px; no console errors, no sideways scroll.
- **What the live check caught, fixed:** a credit shown as a charge on the invoice (adjustments now kept apart on the payout), a cancelled invoice reading "Paid", pay now reporting success on a refused transfer, uncapped owed/owing lists, a cramped refused table. Also the status check not applied at first (caught by a test).
- **Worth knowing:** a full integration run takes 20 to 28 minutes over `ras-x2`. Cancel after a refusal can pay twice if the gateway did send the money; the dialog says to check first.

### 2026-10-07 (Phase 3: the Steadfast gaps, one by one)
- **Owner's request:** "Check how much work we have left" (seven Phase 3 tasks, plus the owner's review and the two
  items waiting on accounts), then "Ok do all of them one by one".
- **Baseline first.** Build 0 warnings; domain 161, architecture 6; integration **72 of 73**: the isolation sweep
  failed on `/Dev/Emails`, a page the last session added without its sweep line (the 2026-10-06 entry promised a full
  run it never recorded). Added to the sweep and to the "not outside Development" check.
- **3.2 More parcel tabs, done.** `ParcelTab` gained `PartlyDelivered` (Delivered is now full deliveries only; the
  dashboards count partly delivered apart, and the delivery rate still counts both), `InReview` and `Exceptional`.
  New `Domain/Parcels/ParcelIssue.cs`; `Parcel.Flag` (only while the courier has the parcel, a note of at most 200,
  keeps the time it was first flagged) and `Parcel.ClearFlag` write a history line each and raise no event, so no
  webhook; `Parcel.AssignTo` refuses a flagged parcel. Schema: `Issue`, `IssueNote`, `IssueRaisedOn`,
  `chk_Parcel_Issue` and the filtered `IX_Parcel_Tenant_Issue` (both databases published). Hub parcel page: "Flag a
  problem" (kind, what is wrong) and "Clear the flag" (what was done); the assign page shows a flagged parcel with
  no box to tick, the hub board shows the flag; the admin dashboard counts both kinds; the merchant gets the tabs, the
  flag in its list, an alert on the parcel and a banner on its dashboard; `GET /api/v1/parcels/{code}` returns
  `issue` and `issueNote`.
- **Tested:** domain **165** (four new: flag and clear, flagging again, who can be flagged, a flag raised while out
  with a rider); integration **76 of 76 over `ras-x2`, none skipped**, with three new `ParcelTabsTests` (a hub flag in
  the merchant's tab only, refused at the assign page, cleared and handed out; an admin's exceptional flag; partly
  delivered apart from delivered).
- **Live on `OneDrop-Test`** (port 5090: another app of the owner's, Grabity.Api, holds 5080) with headless Chrome at
  1440 px and 390 px: flagged OD10000519 at Mirpur as the admin, saw it refused a box on the assign page, in the
  "In review" tab, on the admin dashboard, and as Fashion House in the tab, the parcel and the dashboard banner; then
  cleared it ("Review finished: Live check finished"). No console errors, no sideways scroll.
- **What the screenshots caught, all fixed:** eleven tabs need 1577 px and the bar had 1118 px with its scrollbar
  hidden, so the last tabs (the open "In review" among them) were cut off on a desk; it was already a little over with
  eight. Tabs now wrap onto a second row on a desk and stay one swipeable row on a phone, where `site.js` scrolls the
  open tab into view. The red count first used the class `alert`, which is the page alert component (padding, border,
  margin), and blew the tab up; renamed `count-review` / `count-exception`.
- **Worth knowing:** `sed -i` from Git Bash rewrites a CRLF file as LF (it happened to Project-Context.md, put back);
  and line 1 of Project-Context.md held a stray copy of the moderators decision row from the last session's perl
  mishap, above the title. Removed.
- **3.3 Stats page, done.** New `Domain/Common/Period.cs` (the named periods, and a custom one checked: both days, in
  order, not after today, at most 366 days), `ParcelStatsHandler` (one `GROUP BY` over the parcels booked in the
  period, merchant-filtered, every status listed even at zero) and `/Merchant/Stats` (moderators with the dashboard
  permission; in the menu under the dashboard and among the dashboard's tools). Rates: delivery and return out of the
  parcels that reached an end with the courier, cancel out of everything booked; "—" while there is nothing to divide.
  Each status row links to the parcel list for its tab and those days.
- **Tested:** domain **171** (six new `PeriodTests`); integration **78 of 78, none skipped**, with two new
  `StatsTests` (five parcels in five states plus one booked forty days ago: counts, rates, cash, the custom period,
  a period backwards; another merchant counts none of them) and the sweep's `/Merchant/Stats` line. Live as Fashion
  House at 1440 px and 390 px: last 30 days, last month (the empty state), a custom range and a backwards one; no
  console errors, no sideways scroll.
- **What the screenshots caught, fixed:** the number cards were written flat (icon, label, value side by side), which
  the card style lays out wrongly; they need the label, value and note wrapped in one `div`, as the dashboard does. The
  admin's Reports page from the last session had the same flat cards and showed "Delivered 255 109 returned" in a
  jumble; fixed the same way. The custom-period date boxes stretched to full width; now 170 px each.
- **3.4 Returns the merchant signs for, done.** `Domain/Delivery/ReturnList.cs` (`ReturnList`, `ReturnListParcel`;
  out, handed over, confirmed, not handed over) and `Parcel.CanGoBackFrom` / `SendBack` / `HandBackAtDoor` /
  `MissHandBack`; tables `Delivery.ReturnList`, `Delivery.ReturnListParcel` and the sequence
  `Delivery.ReturnListNumber`, in the security policy. `ReturnListsHandler` (hub and rider; the hand-over writes the
  ledger lines in the same save) and `MerchantReturnsHandler`. Pages `/Hub/Returns` (also the hub board's "Hand back"
  step and the hub chooser), `/Rider/Return/{number}` with a "Returns to hand back" section on the rider's home,
  `/Merchant/Returns` and `/Merchant/Return/{number}`; a dashboard banner while a list waits to be confirmed.
- **3.5 Requests, done.** `Domain/Parcels/ParcelRequest.cs` and `Parcel.ChangeCod`; table `Parcels.ParcelRequest` (one
  open per parcel). `ParcelRequestsHandler`; the merchant parcel page's "Ask the courier" (change the cash, cancel)
  replaces "Ask for it back"; `/Merchant/Requests`, `/Admin/Requests` (in the admin menu, a dashboard banner), and the
  open request shown on the hub's parcel page.
- **3.6 Payout accounts and pay now, done.** `MerchantPayoutAccount` with the account check shared with
  `Merchant.SetPayoutAccount` (`PayoutAccounts.Read`); table `Merchants.MerchantPayoutAccount` and
  `Scripts/2026/004_PayoutAccounts.sql`, which kept each account's existing one (1,823 in `OneDrop-Test`).
  `PayoutAccountsHandler` behind Settings (add, use, remove; the in-use one cannot be removed); the admin's payout
  form keeps its account in the list too. `PayoutsJob.PayNowAsync` and "Get paid now" on Payments, which now splits
  the balance into ready, today and still to collect, and shows a mobile account in its local form.
- **3.7 The bell, done.** `MerchantBellHandler` works the last week's notices out of parcels, attempts, flags, return
  lists, requests and payouts; the layout draws it for merchants, `site.js` keeps "seen" in a cookie per login.
- **3.8 Small things, done.** `ParcelListHandler.ExportAsync` and `/Merchant/Export` (the parcel list's Export button
  now uses it, so it is no longer cut at 100 rows); `ParcelStatsHandler.ByDayAsync` and `/Merchant/ByDate`, sharing
  the stats page's period picker (`_PeriodPicker`); the merchant ID with a copy button in the account menu and on
  Settings, found by the admin's merchant search; empty parcel lists, labels and stats offer their next action.
- **Tested:** build 0 errors, 0 warnings; domain **182** (new: `ReturnListTests` 4, `ParcelRequestTests` 5,
  `PayoutAccountTests` 2); architecture 6. Integration: 3.4's full run **80 of 80**; then 3.5 to 3.8 targeted
  (22 of 22) and together in one full run of **87**: 85 passed, and two 3.2 tests failed because the new bell names
  flagged and partly delivered parcels on every page, so "this code is not in that tab" found it in the bell; they
  now read the list below the tabs. New: `ReturnListsTests` (2), `ParcelRequestsTests` (3), `PayoutAccountsTests` (3),
  `BellTests` (1), and sweep lines for `/Hub/Returns`, `/Rider/Return`, `/Merchant/Returns`, `/Merchant/Return`,
  `/Merchant/Requests`, `/Admin/Requests`, `/Merchant/Export` and `/Merchant/ByDate`. Both databases published.
- **Live on `OneDrop-Test`** at 1440 px and 390 px: returned OD10000519 at Mirpur and sent it on RL-100009 with Rafiq
  Hasan, handed it over from his phone, confirmed it as Fashion House with a note (the hub sees the note); asked to
  change OD10000516's cash from ৳450 to ৳400, approved it as the admin, saw the answer and the history line; kept a
  Nagad account without using it; delivered OD10000517 from the rider's phone and was paid now (INV-100245); the
  bell listed the delivery, the return and the list, then the payout; downloaded the CSV; by date; the merchant ID.
  No console errors, no sideways scroll at either width. Fixed on the way: "All 1 handed over", the CSV's money
  written two ways, an empty stage tab offering "Book a parcel", and Payments showing a bKash number as +880.
- **Not done:** the API cannot ask for a cancellation or cash change yet (it still cancels before pickup only); no
  limit on "Get paid now"; the bell does not follow a person to another browser.

### 2026-10-06 (Phase 2 finished as far as it can be — email, run sheet, reports)
- **Owner's request:** "Complete Phase 2", and "as we cant intigrate read SMS lets use mail insted", with a Gmail
  address and an app password. Asked and answered: the emails go to **merchants only** (recipients have no email
  address in our model, so they keep the fake SMS until there is a gateway), and the bKash / Nagad / bank payout
  gateways and the app's own SQL login are **left alone** ("we still dont have those so leave them").
- **The mail server (2.6, the half we can do).** `IEmailSender` with `SmtpEmailSender` (STARTTLS, one client per
  message) and `FakeEmailSender`; which one is used depends on whether `Email:Host` and `Email:From` are set. The
  Gmail address and its **app password live only in the git-ignored `src/Web/appsettings.Local.json`**; `appsettings.json`
  holds empty defaults, the README says how to fill them, and `WebAppFactory` forces the fake so a test run can never
  send real mail. New `/Dev/Emails` lists what was sent and has a button that sends a test email through the real
  server.
- **2.4 Merchant notifications.** `Payout.MarkPaid` now raises `PayoutPaid` (once, however often the gateway's answer
  is recorded); the outbox writes a `MerchantEmailMessage`, and `SendEmailsJob` — a third loop beside the texts and
  the webhooks — sends it. The email is composed at send time from the payout as it then is: cash collected, charges,
  what was sent, the account (last four digits only) and a link to the invoice. It goes to the merchant's contact
  email, or the account's first login if it has none; a merchant with neither is skipped rather than retried.
  `ITrackingLinks` gained `Invoice(number)`.
- **2.3 Run sheet.** `RunsHandler.SheetAsync` and `/Hub/RunSheet/{id}`: the parcels of the run **still to hand over**
  (a parcel the rider has recorded drops off), each with the door, the phone, the note, the attempt number and the
  cash, with totals and lines to sign. Printed from the page; offered in the toast as soon as parcels are assigned
  (`AssignResult` now carries the run id) and from the closing page while a rider is out.
- **2.5 Reports.** New `ReportsHandler` and `/Admin/Reports` over any period up to 92 days (a week by default):
  day by day (delivered, returned, cash collected, delivery / COD / return charges, earned, owed to merchants), by
  rider (stops, deliveries, success rate, cash collected against cash handed in, what is short, runs still open) and
  returns by merchant (rate and return charges). Each table downloads as CSV. The money comes from the ledger (whose
  `EntryDate` is already the courier's day) and the counts from the parcels that reached a final status, whose UTC
  `ClosedOn` is turned into the courier's day in memory — the window is capped at 92 days so that set stays small.
- **Tested:** build 0 errors, 0 warnings; domain **161** (one new assertion: a payout tells the merchant once);
  architecture 6. Integration: new `MerchantEmailTests`, `RunSheetTests` (2) and `ReportsTests` (2), plus two new
  sweep lines (`/Hub/RunSheet`, `/Admin/Reports`); the full run is recorded below. **The Gmail credentials were
  proved live** — an SMTP send from PowerShell was accepted, and the app's own sender delivered a test email through
  `smtp.gmail.com` from `/Dev/Emails`.
- **Worth knowing:** `perl -0pi -e` mangles any replacement containing `$"` (Perl reads it as a variable) — several
  C# interpolated strings were silently emptied before I noticed. Use the editor, not perl, for those.

### 2026-10-06 (later still: the gaps from Steadfast's panel, and moderators)
- **Owner's request:** ten screenshots of Steadfast's merchant panel — "Check these feature. We dont have a lot of
  them. These will help to improve our system" — then "list them down and remember them and start doing them one by
  one", with moderators first.
- **Listed:** the gap analysis became Phase 3 (3.1 to 3.8) above. Not taken: a prepaid wallet (Add fund / Check
  balance), Pick-n-Drop and "My incoming", and the Bangla switch.
- **3.1 Moderators, done.** A moderator is an ordinary merchant login plus a `Merchants.Moderator` row holding what
  they may do (`MerchantPermissions`: dashboard, parcels, booking, payments, tools, settings). The row hangs off the
  account's **main profile**, not a business, so one moderator works in every business of the account; it therefore
  carries `AccountId` and is not merchant-filtered (noted in Database.md). `/Merchant/Moderators` (owner only) lists
  them with inline tick boxes, adds one, gives out a new password, stops one and lets them back in.
- **How they are held:** `MerchantPermissionFilter` on the whole `/Merchant` folder reads the rights once per
  request, leaves them on `HttpContext.Items`, and refuses any page whose entry in `Web/Authentication/MerchantPages.cs`
  the person does not hold. The list is **default-deny**: a merchant page not on it is the owner's alone, so a page
  added later cannot quietly open itself. The menu, the favourites bar and the dashboard (quick actions, tools, the
  money card, latest parcels, the banners) only offer what the person may open, and the account card reads "Moderator".
- **Stopping one** archives the row and locks the login out (`IUserAccounts.SetLoginEnabledAsync`: `Archived`, lockout
  to `DateTimeOffset.MaxValue`, security stamp changed), so an open session ends and a fresh sign-in is refused.
- **No email yet**, so the first password is shown once on the page for the owner to hand over, and can be issued
  again; the person changes it at `/Account/Password`. Generated as capitals, letters and digits so it always passes
  the sign-in rules.
- **Tested:** build 0 errors, 0 warnings; domain **161** (four new in `ModeratorTests`), architecture 6; integration
  **68 of 68 over `ras-x2`, none skipped**, including two new `ModeratorsTests` (what a moderator may open, what is
  refused, permissions changed, stopped and shut out; and that no other account sees or stops them) and the sweep's
  new `/Merchant/Moderators` line. Both databases published (`Merchants.Moderator`, in the security policy).
- **Live on `OneDrop-Test`** at 1440 px and 390 px with headless Chrome: added a moderator as Fashion House, signed in
  as them, dashboard and parcels answered 200 while payments, booking, settings, API keys and the moderators page all
  went to `AccessDenied`; the sidebar showed four items instead of fifteen; permissions changed and the refusals
  followed. No sideways scroll at either width, no console errors.
- **Two things the screenshots caught**, both fixed: the dashboard still linked to pages a moderator may not open
  (the integration test found it first), and the permission ticks in the table were cramped — they are now two
  columns, with the "added" date folded under the email so the buttons are not pushed off the card.
- **Not done:** an emailed invitation code (there is no email sender; waits on 2.6), the courier admin cannot see an
  account's moderators, and the permission check is page-level, not inside each handler.

### 2026-10-06 (later: the coverage map the admin keeps)
- **Owner's request:** "The Coverage area and Hub area are now seeded data. Keep these but also add a option to make it
  dynamic so admin can add more or remove any of the existing." That is task 2.2, done without questions.
- **Decided, and worth knowing:** "remove" is **archive, never delete**. A deleted zone would orphan the parcels that
  were priced and routed by it (`Parcel.AreaId`, `PickupHubId`, `DeliveryHubId` all point at these rows), so a part of
  the map that comes off leaves the address lists, the API and the public map while its rows and history stay. The seed
  still lays the map out; nothing about it changed.
- **Domain:** `Hub`, `Zone` and `Area` gained `Create` / `Change` / `Archive` / `Restore` with their own validation
  (they had public constructors and no rules before). New `Domain/Network/Codes.cs` reads a hub or zone code: letters
  and digits, at most 20, held in capitals, because codes are printed on labels and read out over the phone.
- **Application:** new `CoverageAdminHandler` (list, add, edit, archive, restore for all three) with the guards, in the
  same spirit as the rider and pickup-point ones of this morning — nothing moves out from under work in flight:
  a hub closes only once its zones, riders, parcels and pickups have gone; a zone keeps its hub, city and suburb flag
  while parcels priced by them are still moving, and leaves the map only once its areas have; an area stays put while
  parcels are on their way there or a merchant collects from it; a zone or area comes back only onto an open parent.
  Codes are unique per courier and area names are unique per courier, each with a message instead of a database error.
- **UI:** `/Admin/Coverage` keeps the map it always showed as its first tab and gains **Hubs**, **Zones** and **Areas**,
  each a table with inline edit, an add form beside it and a confirm dialog on anything that comes off the map. The
  areas tab filters by zone (87 areas are too many to read at once) and the zones tab's area count links to it.
- **No schema change:** all three tables already carried `Archived`, so neither database needed a publish.
- **Tested:** build 0 errors, 0 warnings; domain 157 (11 new in `CoverageTests`), architecture 6; integration **66 of 66
  over `ras-x2`, none skipped**, including three new `CoverageAdminTests` (add a hub, a zone and an area and book to it
  through the API; the guards refuse and an empty area comes off; another courier can neither see it nor post to it)
  and the sweep's four Coverage lines. Live on the **dev** database at 1440 px and 390 px: opened a hub, drew a zone on
  it, added an area, saw all three on the map; the refusals appeared word for word ("Live check hub cannot close yet:
  1 zone it serves…", "Livepur still covers 1 area…", "Livepur Sadar sits in a zone the courier no longer covers…");
  then the area came off, the zone, and the hub closed. Four tabs, the zone filter narrowing 88 areas to 8, no sideways
  scroll at either width, no console errors. The live-check hub, zone and area were deleted from dev afterwards
  (16 hubs, 21 zones, 87 areas again).
- **Two things to know:** the first full run failed one assertion of mine — the sweep looked for "Mirpur hub", which the
  new add-hub form carries as a *placeholder*, not as another courier's data; the sweep now checks data-only strings.
  And two full runs in a row failed 11 and 41 tests purely on the `ras-x2` link dropping (pre-login handshake timeouts,
  "physical connection is not usable"), while `sqlcmd` answered instantly between them; the third run was clean. The
  link is flaky, not the code.
- **Not done:** an owner's look at the new tabs; hubs, zones and areas still cannot be imported in bulk.

### 2026-10-06
- **Owner's request (later): a picture for the main profile and each business, and a new footer credit.** Settings has an upload (and remove) for the business being worked in; new table `Merchants.MerchantPicture` (in the security policy, published to both databases), `MerchantPicture` entity that accepts only PNG, JPEG or WebP by their first bytes up to 512 KB, `MerchantPictureHandler`, `/Merchant/Picture/{id}` (404 for another account), shown in the sidebar, account menu, business switcher and businesses page. The footer now reads "Developed and designed by Talha from Octopi Digital" linking to octopi-digital.com (both layouts). Tests: five domain, two integration (`MerchantPictureTests`) and a sweep line.
- **Owner's request:** "Make our website UI also like this [Steadfast's panel] … this one looks much better", then "I
  like that favourite tab which stays in every page and user can customize them. Also the user setting panel at the
  top right side." Also: "use ras-x2 now" for the SQL Server.
- **Shell (every panel):** white sidebar with the signed-in account on top and sign out in red; the top bar carries the
  page title, the searches, the hide-amounts switch and the hotline (tap to call); larger type, rounder cards; number
  cards read icon and label, then the number, then context (CSS only, `display: contents`, so no page changed); the
  "next step" banner is light.
- **Merchant dashboard:** "Hello, {shop}"; "Right now" (each stage with its count and cash, a chevron to the tab) beside
  quick actions; tools and links; "Your last 30 days" (booked today and yesterday, booked in 30 days, delivery success,
  cash collected); the week; the money with the last payment; latest parcels. `MerchantDashboard` gained `Booked` and
  `LastPayout`. **Payments:** the next payout large, beside how it adds up (cash, delivery, COD and return charges).
- **Favourites and account menu:** the menu is now one list (`Display/Menu.cs`) that draws the sidebar, the stars and
  the favourites bar (merchant, admin, hub; up to eight; defaults per role; a cookie per login, `-` meaning none). The
  avatar opens the account menu: name, email, role, account pages, change password, sign out. New
  `/Account/Password` (any signed-in person), in the isolation sweep.
- **SQL Server:** both `*.Local.json` now use `ras-x2,1433` (resolves to 192.168.0.237, same instance, both databases
  there); docs updated.
- **Tested:** build 0 errors, 0 warnings; domain 137, architecture 6; integration 59 over `ras-x2`, none skipped — 58
  passed in the full run, and the favourites test, which had caught a real bug (unpinning everything brought the
  defaults back), passed after the fix (`AccountMenuTests` 2 of 2). Live on `OneDrop-Test` and dev at 1440 px and
  390 px: merchant dashboard, payments, admin dashboard, hub board, favourites (pin from a star, picker, reload keeps
  them), account menu, change password; no sideways scroll.
- **Two things went wrong on the way, both mine:** a viewport size I set on the DevTools tab while testing made the
  owner's view look cut off on the right; and starting the app with `--no-build` after editing `site.css` served
  browsers an empty stylesheet (stale gzip copy; now in Project-Context's traps). Both fixed.
- **Not done:** a Bangla switch and a dark theme (seen at Steadfast; product work);
  favourites do not follow a person to another browser (would need a column on the user).
- **Later (owner's request): several businesses in one merchant account**, as on Steadfast. Each business is a
  merchant row of its own (`Merchant.MainMerchantId` points an added one at the account's main profile), so parcels,
  pickups, pickup points, balance, payouts, API keys and webhook stay per business with no change to them. The login's
  claims list its other businesses; a cookie per login picks the one worked in and `ICurrentUser.MerchantId` returns
  it (a cookie naming anyone else's business is ignored). Approval and the payout account are the account's: set on the
  main profile and followed by every business (`FollowAccount`), from the merchant's settings or the admin's page.
  New `/Merchant/Businesses` (cards with each one's parcels on the way and money waiting, open another) and
  `/Merchant/NewBusiness`; a switcher under the account card in the sidebar and in the account menu; the admin's
  merchant list and page say which account a business belongs to. Schema published to both databases.
- **Tested:** build 0 warnings; domain 140 (three new), architecture 6; integration 61 over `ras-x2`, none skipped:
  60 passed in the full run, including the two new `MerchantBusinessesTests` (add, work in it, own parcels, payout
  account shared, forged cookie, suspension covers the account) and the sweep's two new lines; `FailedMessagesTests`
  failed because my live-check app on `OneDrop-Test` sent its planted text, and passed alone with the app stopped (now a
  trap). The first targeted run caught a 500 on every merchant page (the switcher partial's model type), fixed before
  the full run. Live on `OneDrop-Test` at about 1265 px: added "Fashion House Kids", landed in it with its own empty
  dashboard, switched back (the main profile kept its 6 parcels), businesses page, account menu switcher; no sideways
  scroll. The top bar squeezed the page title at that width; below 1400 px the searches narrow and the hotline is its
  icon.
- **Then (owner):** "Steadfast allows 10, then also make ours 10"; and no login per business: "I already logged in to
  get into the merchant so I don't need other login". The limit is a courier setting, `Tenant.MaxBusinessesPerAccount`
  (NULL: none), set to 10 for OneDrop Courier by `003_BusinessesPerAccount.sql`; the main profile does not count, as on
  Steadfast ("0 of 10 businesses"). `Merchant.AddBusiness` refuses the eleventh; the businesses page says "n of 10
  businesses added" and drops "Add business" when full; the add page explains instead of offering a form. Published to
  both databases (the test-only "rival" courier has no limit).
- **Tested:** build 0 errors, 0 warnings; domain 141 (one new: up to the limit, refused at it, no limit when NULL),
  architecture 6; integration 61 of 61 over `ras-x2`, none skipped (the businesses page reads "1 of 10 businesses
  added"). A first run hung for 17 minutes after the connection to `ras-x2` dropped at 11:53 ("physical connection is
  not usable"); stopped and run again.
- **Then (owner):** "make the unactive business in gray color". In the business switcher (sidebar and account menu)
  the businesses not being worked in now have a grey tile and grey name; the open one keeps its sky blue. CSS only;
  the rebuilt app serves the new rules.
- **Then (owner):** the favourites bar ran out of room before eight tabs. Each chip now shrinks as more are pinned
  (`:has(.fav-chip:nth-child(6|7|8))`, counted on the chips because they are the first children of `.favbar-items`):
  at six the chips are 35 px and 13 px, at seven 33 px and 12.5 px with the "Favourites" word dropped (the star stays),
  at eight 32 px and 12 px; below 1400 px a full bar tightens once more. CSS only, so nothing had to re-render; the
  overflow scroll stays as the last resort. Checked at 1920, 1440 and 1280 px with five, six, seven and eight chips:
  all eight fit on one line beside the 256 px sidebar at every one of them. Build 0 errors, 0 warnings; the rebuilt app
  serves the new rules.

### 2026-10-05 (later: Steadfast's panel, then reweighing at the hub)
- **Owner's request:** look at Steadfast's merchant dashboard in Chrome and make ours as easy to use, without copying it.
- **Getting at it:** Chrome 136+ ignores `--remote-debugging-port` against the default profile, by design, so it was
  driven over DevTools with its own `--user-data-dir` (`.chrome-debug`, excluded in `.git/info/exclude`) and a
  one-time sign-in. A screenshot had suggested their top bar held a customer fraud check; the DOM showed it is a parcel
  search with a field selector (Parcel ID / Phone / Invoice / Tracking code) plus a prepaid **balance** button, so that
  reading was wrong. Their order list and add-parcel form could not be read: the account is unverified, so it has no
  parcels and `/add-parcel` redirects to the KYC form.
- **Taken from them:** cash shown beside every stage count; a hide-amounts toggle (theirs defaults to hidden, ours to
  shown); banners that carry the button that fixes them. **Not taken:** the field selector (our one box already searches
  code, phone and name), the menu search and favourites bar (both answer a 30-item sidebar we do not have). **Noted as
  product gaps, not UI:** several businesses per login, moderators, payment request, prepaid funds, WhatsApp updates.
- **Merchant and admin panels:** a customer check in the merchant top bar (`/Merchant/FraudCheck` on GET, my own idea,
  not theirs); per-stage cash on the merchant tiles ("to collect" while on the way, "collected" once delivered) and on
  the admin's "Parcels in progress"; a hide-amounts switch in the top bar, read before first paint so nothing flashes —
  one change to `Money.Taka` (the digits moved into `.amount-figure`) made every taka in the app maskable; pending and
  suspended banners gained "Add your payout account" and a tap-to-dial hotline; quick-action tiles on the merchant
  dashboard, mainly for phones where the sidebar is behind the menu button.
- **Logic gap closed — nobody could weigh a parcel.** `WeightGrams` was whatever the merchant typed and froze at
  pickup, so a 5 kg parcel booked as 500 g travelled for ৳60 for ever. A hub now weighs it on the parcel page
  (`Parcel.Reweigh`): the delivery charge is worked out again on the scale's reading, the merchant's own figure is
  kept, and the history records both weights and both charges. Repricing from today's rate card would have broken
  "charges snapshot at booking" (`DeliveryRate.Change` edits the row in place, so there is no rate history), so the
  parcel now carries the weight rule it was booked under — `IncludedWeightGrams`, `BaseCharge`, `ExtraKgCharge` on
  `ParcelCharges` and the table, backfilled by `Scripts/Pre/002_ParcelWeightRule.sql`.
- **Two failures fixed that were already on `main`** from `ce576c1`, not from this work: the isolation sweep had no
  line for `/Admin/Vehicles`, and `RowLevelSecurityTests` planted a rider with a raw INSERT written before the NOT NULL
  `Vehicle` column, so it died on that instead of reaching the block predicate.
- **Tested:** build 0 errors, 0 warnings; domain 137 (five new: the charge follows the scale, a rate change since
  booking does not reach it, only while the courier has it to deliver, and two refused weights), architecture 6. Both
  databases published. Integration run recorded below.
- **Worth knowing:** `dotnet test --project tests/...` reports "Zero tests ran" (exit 5) on this machine; the suites
  run when the test executables are invoked directly. The documented command in Conventions.md does not work as written.

### 2026-10-05
- **Owner's request:** "make the UI more beautiful … professional … add beautiful animation … make the whole system user
  friendly … also find if there is any logical gap then fix them." Done without questions (owner asleep).
- **UI:** `site.css` rewritten on the same class names: Plus Jakarta Sans and JetBrains Mono (`_Fonts.cshtml`), refined
  tokens and shadows, a glowing active-menu bar, lifted hover cards, numbers that count up, bars and progress that grow,
  a breathing "Live" dot and changed numbers flashing on live refresh, all on first paint only and off for reduced
  motion. New `site.js`: busy spinners and no double posts, a styled confirm dialog (`data-confirm`, replacing every
  `confirm()` and added to stop rider, run payouts, cancel pickup, return parcel, new webhook secret, stop webhook),
  success toasts, dismissible tips, "/" to search, show password, copy tracking code.
- **Guidance:** merchant "Get started" checklist (approval, payout account, first parcel, first handover) then a "next
  step" banner when parcels wait without a pickup; hub board as the day's six numbered steps with counts and links;
  tips on assign, runs, pickups; sidebar "how it works" per role; tracking page says in one sentence what happens next.
- **Screens:** scan page sends scans without reloading, plays a tone per result (high done, low problem; can be muted),
  keeps the session's scans and catches keystrokes for the scanner; assign page counts ticked parcels and "select all"
  skips parcels whose customer asked for a later day (marked in the row, also on the board); rider closing asks before
  closing with cash short; rider app shows day progress and a Map button, and asks for a partial-delivery reason only
  when less was collected; pickups warn when nothing is booked at the point and fill the count; booking form links a
  phone to its fraud check and flashes changed charges; sign-in is a split screen; landing page has a moving route and
  journey.
- **Logic gaps closed:** (1) stopping a rider, or moving them to another hub, while they carry parcels, have an open
  run or an assigned pickup is refused with what is open (their parcels would be stuck: the rider app shows nothing to
  a stopped rider and the run closes at the old hub). (2) A pickup point cannot move to another zone while parcels or a
  pickup wait there (they were priced and routed by the old zone). (3) `Parcel.Hold` refuses a "deliver on" day that is
  not after today; the date picker starts tomorrow.
- **Tested:** build 0 errors, 0 warnings (two old xUnit2029 warnings in `DatabaseProjectFileTests` fixed); domain 111
  (one new), architecture 6, integration 55 (two new in `GuardTests`), none skipped. Live check on `OneDrop-Test` with
  demo logins (the dev database has no demo users): every role's main pages at 1366 px and 390 px, no script errors, no
  sideways scroll; scanned five labels without reloads, assigned three parcels (toast), the stop-rider dialog and its
  refusal, a partial delivery's reason appearing. Screenshots showed the hero route crossing the text, the scan
  placeholder in capitals, the sign-in art over the role list and long demo e-mails overflowing; all fixed and
  re-checked. Six parcels for the demo shop "Fashion House" were left in `OneDrop-Test`.
- **Not done:** sound on a real hand scanner; phone screenshots of the admin pages.
- **Later the same day (owner's request):** "I want my landing page also like [Steadfast's] but not copy paste … a beautiful
  graphical cartoon type animation … change our color theme, it looks like copy of steadfast courier … make a good
  business logo." A first draft in ultraviolet was stopped by the owner: "dont use ultraviolet color, that color makes
  it feel like AI generated. Use some other color theme and the coloring minimal."
- **Brand:** logo = a drop-shaped map pin holding a taped parcel, landing on a ripple, on a marigold tile
  (`_BrandMark.cshtml` in pages; `wwwroot/images/logo.svg` and `logo-on-dark.svg` with the word outlined from
  Bricolage Grotesque; `icons/icon.svg`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` and a new full-bleed `icon-maskable-512.png`).
  Theme = ink `#17181c` on warm paper `#f7f6f3`, one accent marigold `#f2a900`; primary buttons solid ink, `btn-accent`
  for the few marketing calls to action; every gradient and glow removed; "out for delivery" is an ink badge; charts
  grey, ink and red. All of it through the tokens in `site.css`, so every panel changed with it.
- **Front page:** a little planet (shops, a hub, homes, a rickshaw, krishnachura trees, a route map on its face) turning
  under a rider on a scooter, parcels on parachutes and status cards following one parcel (`Art/_Planet.cshtml`, three
  layers so the planet turns on the compositor); a ribbon of services; four animated steps (book, pick up, hub belt
  and scanner, cash into the wallet); services; rate card (inside city in ink); a closing pin that drops on a ripple;
  a real footer. `landing.css` is loaded by the front page only; `site.js` pauses a drawing off screen and lets
  sections below the fold rise in. Tracking page uses the same tracking box.
- **Tested:** build 0 errors, 0 warnings; domain 111, architecture 6, integration 57 (two new in `PortalPagesTests`:
  the front page's drawings, tracking box and rates; every icon in the rider manifest exists), none skipped, two full
  green runs in a row. One earlier run had `/Admin` answer 500 once after 13 s in `Each_role_lands_on_its_own_home`
  (only a class name changed there; not reproduced in three more runs; looks like a database timeout under parallel
  load). Live: front page at 1440 px and 390 px (no sideways scroll, no script errors), merchant, admin and hub panels
  at 1440 px, rider app at 390 px, sign-in, sign-up and tracking on `OneDrop-Test` with demo logins. Screenshots showed
  birds flying over the headline, a gap after the price in rate lists (old), the tracking progress bar turned into
  cards by a clashing `.step` class, the tracking placeholder cut off on phones and the hub tip still saying "orange";
  all fixed and re-checked.
- **Not done:** a look on a real phone and in Safari; the intermittent `/Admin` 500 is not explained.
- **Then (owner's review):** "I don't like the yellow color theme … try something light color like sky blue." The
  accent is now sky blue `#7cc6f2` (`--accent-text` `#0b6a9e` for links and text, `--accent-soft` `#d9effc`), and the
  neutrals moved from warm paper to cool light grey (`--bg` `#f5f7fa`, ink `#141820`) because cream beside sky blue
  looked muddy in screenshots. Logo tile, app icons and logo files regenerated in sky blue; drawings' second tone light
  sky `#c6e7fb`; the sun is white with sky rays; the dev strip and the "needs you" stat cards follow the accent; the
  hub tip says "a blue number". Tested: build 0 warnings; 111 + 6 + 57 pass, none skipped; live at 1440 px and 390 px
  (front page, merchant panel), no sideways scroll or script errors.
- **Then:** the owner asked for a more professional headline. Now "Reliable delivery. Next-day payouts." (58 px, was
  62 px) with a plainer lead and the label "Courier service for online businesses"; checked at 1440 px and 390 px.

### 2026-10-04
- **Decided with the owner:** the pivot above.
- **Done:** phase 1 (tasks 1.1–1.8). Both databases dropped (no sessions open) and deployed from nothing with the new
  dacpac and seed.
- **Tested:** build 0 errors, 0 warnings; 109 domain + 6 architecture + 50 integration = 165 pass, none skipped.
  The integration run found two EF queries that grouped then joined (admin payouts, admin dashboard: 500), now
  aggregated first; public tracking showed the collected amount through an event note, now each step shows its status
  only; the out-for-delivery text is correctly skipped once the parcel is delivered (the test now sends between
  steps). Live on dev: every page answered 200 for its role (public, merchant, hub, rider, admin, Dev), the sample
  parcels' texts went out, no errors in the log. Screenshots at 1366 px and 390 px (DevTools emulation) of 15 pages,
  no sideways scroll at phone width; they showed the app shell broken on desktop (the menu scrim label took a grid
  cell), the search icon over its placeholder, the brand label wrapping, a poor ৳ glyph, a tiny tracking-code heading,
  the rider's phone in +880 form and "Attempt 0 of 3" while out; all fixed and re-checked.
- **Not done:** a mutation run of the isolation sweep; scanning a printed label with a real hand scanner or phone.
- **Later the same day (owner's review):** branch pushed and fast-forwarded into local `main` (not pushed). Demo data
  removed from the dev database (parcels, riders, demo merchants and logins; hubs, zones, areas, rates, both admins and
  the owner's own sign-up kept) and `Seed:DemoData`/`DemoActivity` turned off in `appsettings.Development.json`.
  The owner found the admin's "Pickups open" tile opened Barishal (first by name) while the pickup was at Mirpur.
  Locking the admin to one hub was considered and rejected (the admin must see the whole courier); instead hub pages
  ask "Choose your hub" (every hub with its waiting work, busiest first) until one is chosen, the choice is forgotten
  at sign-in and sign-out, the dashboard tiles open the one hub with that work (or the chooser), and the hub menu shows
  each hub's waiting count with an "All hubs" link. Tested: build 0 warnings; 109 + 6 + 51 = 166 pass; live on dev as
  admin: `/Hub/Pickups` → chooser, "Pickups open" → Mirpur directly, menu shows "Mirpur hub (MIR) · 1 waiting".
  Not done: screenshots at phone width.
- **Later still (owner's review):** a parcel is now texted a tracking link the moment it is booked, not only when it goes
  out for delivery, so the recipient can follow it from the start. `Parcel.Create` raises a new `ParcelBooked` event,
  kept separate from `ParcelStatusChanged` so booking never posts to the merchant's webhook (that still starts at
  pickup); the outbox writes it as the existing `RecipientTextMessage` with status `Pending`, and `RecipientTexts`
  gained a case for it (dropped if the parcel has already moved on by the time it is sent, same as the others).
  Tested: build 0 warnings; 110 + 6 + 52 = 168 pass (one new domain test, one new and one adjusted integration test);
  live on dev: booked a parcel as a merchant, the tracking SMS appeared in `/Dev/Sms` with a working `/Track` link.
  Test merchant and parcel removed afterwards.
- **Next:** the owner's review (2.1).
